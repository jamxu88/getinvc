<h4 align="center">Temporary voice and text chat lobbies.</h4><br>

### What if there was an easier way to quickly speak to people online?
In many online games, such as League of Legends, only text chat is available to communciate between players. Creating a discord server leads to additional hassle, as members would likely need to leave after, and could be saddled with pings.


### Enter: **getin.vc**
getin.vc is a temporary VOIP lobby platform targeted towards gamers. Share a short join code and **_anyone can connect through their browser_**. Users can join a voice call and a text chat, in just **_two clicks_**. getin.vc contains features designed to make chatting easier like volume sliders for individual users, locking lobbies, and banning users. 

### Features
* Quick & Easy - Join a voice call in just two clicks.
* Botting protection.
* Banning functionality.
* Choose between mute and push-to-talk.
* **All contained in your browser, no software necessary.**
